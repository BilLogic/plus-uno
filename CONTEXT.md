# PLUS Terminology

<!-- canonical per ADR-017 (docs/adr/) · Tier 2 (on demand) · distilled 2026-07-07 · applied by every agent naming a product, org, design-system, or harness term. -->

Use these terms consistently across all design system work, prototypes, and documentation. Do not substitute generic web terms.

## Product terms

| PLUS Term | Meaning | Do NOT use |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Session** | A scheduled tutoring slot (Zoom or Pencil) | "class", "meeting", "appointment" |
| **Reflection** | Post-session tutor self-report | "survey", "feedback form", "review" |
| **Escalation** | Tutor flags session for supervisor review | "report", "incident", "alert" |
| **Call-Off** | Tutor cancels a session | "cancel", "absence", "no-show" (no-show is a separate behavior) |
| **Fill-In** | Tutor covers an open session slot | "substitute", "replacement" |
| **Strike** | Compliance violation (3-strike threshold) | "warning point", "demerit" |
| **TIP** | Tutor Improvement Plan | "probation", "warning" |
| **PIP** | Performance Improvement Plan (escalated from TIP) | "final warning" |
| **Tutor Coach** | AI weekly compliance monitoring system | "monitor", "tracker" |
| **TACT** | Tutor motivation + growth feedback system | "dashboard", "report" |
| **Student Card** | UI component showing student info during session | "student profile", "student row" |
| **Student Insight** | AI-generated student engagement summary | "student report", "analytics" |

## Organizational terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Affiliation** | University: CMU, Pitt, or Duquesne |
| **Site** | School location where students are based |
| **Lead Tutor** | Senior tutor with mentoring + attendance duties |
| **SMART** | PLUS training system |
| **Breakout Room** | Zoom sub-room for one-on-one tutoring |

## Design-system terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Context Level** | Atomic hierarchy: Element → Card → Section → Page |
| **Spec** | Full page composition (e.g., `specs/Home/Pages/`) |
| **Token** | Design value: color, spacing, typography, elevation, radius |
| **Foundation** | Fundamental design primitive (color palette, type scale, grid) |

## Harness & workflow terms

| Term | Meaning | Do NOT use |
|---|---|---|
| **uno** | the design agent, all embodiments (constitution: `AGENTS.md`) | "the AI" |
| **uno-bot** | uno's Slack embodiment — the Cloudflare Worker in `agents/uno-bot/` | "Slackbot" |
| **uno-blueprint** | product source of truth (Supabase) — query at task time, never cache | "the database" |
| **uno-storybook** | design-system source of truth (stories + MDX → /storybook) | "the docs site" |
| **share-out** | a feedback-rail publish: Loom + preview + Decisions DB link (+ replica for prototypes) | "post", "update" |
| **Decisions DB** | centralized decision log under Design HQ — Status / Owner / Sign-off / Date / Roadmap Card / Evidence | "Decision Log" (obsolete per-project subpage) |
| **pillar** | product area (Universal · Admin · Toolkit · Training · Marketing …) — maps to a Slack channel | "category" |
| **replica** | the Figma frame mirroring a coded prototype — required in prototype share-outs | "screenshot" |
| **Tier 1 / Tier 2** (maintenance) | trivial auto-applied fix vs PR+PRD through a Slack verdict | — |
| **Tier 1 / Tier 2** (loading) | always-loaded docs vs on-demand loads (`loading-order.md`) | — |
| **RM-ID** | Roadmap card id (`RM-<n>`) — the Figma↔Notion join key | — |

## Two vocabularies — the blueprint speaks service-blueprint, the Roadmap speaks project-management

Two estates describe the product in **different languages**, and the words are NOT interchangeable. Mixing them is a defect: never describe results from one estate in the other's vocabulary, and never search one estate for the other's concepts.

| | **uno-blueprint** (Supabase) | **Notion Roadmap** (Design HQ board) |
|---|---|---|
| What it holds | how the **service works**: who does what, when | what the **team is building**: work items + their status |
| Its words | **phase** · **service scenario** · **path** (identified by NAME, not `path_type` — `blueprint-navigation.md` § Path semantics) · **step** · **lane** = the actor row · **cell** = one activity at lane × step | **Roadmap** · **card** (id = **RM-ID**, `RM-<n>`) · **Design Status** · **Product Pillar** · **Product Tag** · **owner** · **PRD** |
| NOT its words | "roadmap", "card", "Design Status", "pillar", "owner", "WIP", "under review" — **the blueprint has no cards and no statuses** | "scenario", "lane", "cell", "path", "step", "phase", "actor" — **the Roadmap has no service steps or actor rows** |

**Topic words overlap; frame words don't.** "Goal Setting" is both a blueprint *scenario* and a Roadmap *card topic* — the topic never tells you which estate to read. The **frame words in the question** do:

- card / status / pillar / owner / RM-ID / "where are we on X" / "what's WIP or under review" → **Roadmap** (Notion), full stop.
- who-does-what / flow / scenario / actor / step / "what happens when" → **blueprint** (Supabase), full stop.

**Attribution rule:** when reporting findings, name the estate you actually read, in its own words — "on the Roadmap board" ONLY for Notion Roadmap cards; "in the service blueprint" ONLY for blueprint rows.

## Codify the frame words in chat

When uno-bot (or any agent) writes to Slack or Notion, the estates' FRAME words render as `code` so designers learn to recognize them as system vocabulary, not casual English — Bill, Jul 2026:

- **Blueprint frame words:** `phase` · `scenario` · `path` · `step` · `lane` · `cell`, plus the lane (actor-row) names listed in `blueprint-navigation.md` §3.
- **Roadmap frame words:** `card` · `RM-ID` · `Design Status` · `Dev Status` · `Product Pillar` · `Product Tag` · `Intake Status`.

Scenario and project *names* (Goal Setting, Warm-Up, Session Sign Up) stay `*bold*` — they're topics, not frame words. Codify a frame word when it's used AS the system term ("the `Regular Tutor` `lane`"), not in ordinary prose ("a tutor joins the call").
